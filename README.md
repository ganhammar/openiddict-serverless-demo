# OpenIddict on AWS Serverless: Flexible OAuth2/OIDC Provider

OpenIddict is a flexible OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server for ASP.NET Core. It's an excellent choice for building your own OAuth2/OIDC provider. This project demonstrates how to deploy OpenIddict on AWS Serverless using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Systems Manager Parameter Store, and CloudFront. The related frontend project, which handles user login, can be found [here](https://github.com/ganhammar/openiddict-interactive-login-serverless-demo).

A comprehensive blog post explaining how the solution works can be found [here](https://www.ganhammar.se/posts/openiddict-on-aws-serverless-flexible-oauth2-oidc-provider), and how it can be extended with interactive login [here](https://www.ganhammar.se/posts/openiddict-on-aws-serverless-with-interactive-login).

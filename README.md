# OpenIddict on AWS Serverless: Flexible OAuth2/OIDC Provider

OpenIddict is a flexible OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server for ASP.NET Core. It's a great choice for building your own OAuth2/OIDC provider. This project shows you how to deploy OpenIddict on AWS Serverless using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Systems Manager Parameter Store. It focuses on the OAuth2 Client Credentials flow for simplicity, but you can easily extend it to support other flows.
